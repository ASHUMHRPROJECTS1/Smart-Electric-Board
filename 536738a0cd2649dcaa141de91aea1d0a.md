**Related Download Files**\
As you can see in the pictures above the PCB is very well manufactured
and I've got the same PCB design that we've made for our main board and
all the labels and logos are there to guide me during the soldering
steps. You can also download the Gerber �le for this circuit from the
download link below in case you want to place an order for the same
circuit design.
